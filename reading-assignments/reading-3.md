# Reading 3 (Surveillance Capitalism)

### Response
Though there have been already many commentary works from various fields of discipline orbited this topic, it is still quite insightful to read Dr. Zuboff’s systematic and structured analysis. From my understanding, “Surveillance Capitalism” originally refers to a grand vision of digital capitalism according to her example of “Aware Home” raised in 2000, where users’ data is supposed to better serve the user experience. Yet due to the “unprecedented asymmetries in knowledge and the power that accrues to knowledge”, it departs into a new economic order and further becomes a “rogue mutation of capitalism marked by concentrations of wealth, knowledge, and power unprecedented in human history”. Therefore in the current era, by “Surveillance Capitalism”, Zuboff indeed refers to a dynamic mechanism ( a “new economic order” in her own word) that applied consciously or not by business cooperations to gather personal information (“data”) in order to make profits by predicting and even influencing our behaviors.

Zuboff argues that we barely benefit from surveillance capitalism since we are only “free raw material for translation into behavioral data” unilaterally claimed by it, yet further services derived from our data do facilitate our life more or less. From my point of view, our role in the debate on surveillance capitalism is more a trade-off decider (in addition to one of the gears of the big cycles unavoidably shown in the figures) than “data source” or a victim only, and we do locate ourselves in a far more sophisticated relationship with the great data surveillance. In this sense, what I consider as more dangerous is the fact that we are actually feeling increasingly comfortable with and unconsciously consenting to such surveillance capitalism regardless of the above awareness — and this might better justify Zuboff’s concerns expressed in her overall book, talks and [interviews](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/04/shoshana-zuboff-surveillance-capitalism-assault-human-automomy-digital-privacy). I feel more than enlightened by the analogy between surveillance capitalism and early colonialism, and its consequences for sure serve as one of our persuasive references to ponder over such issues.
