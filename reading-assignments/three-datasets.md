## Three Good Datasets

1. [Nike Manufacturing Map](http://manufacturingmap.nikeinc.com/#)  

This is Nike, Inc.’s manufacturing map, which includes data on all factories and material suppliers to manufacture its products. With the content of country/region, address, the number of workers, percentage of female workers, etc, I might be able to analyze the data further to visualize factory information and related implications.


2. [Human Memory and Cognition](https://www.kaggle.com/manishkc06/human-memory-and-cognition)  

This is a dataset made to explore relationships between human recall and imagination towards same issues via Natural Language Processing. The topic is quite interesting, yet I haven’t decided how to visualize it in an effective way so that the perception between recall and imagination can be interpreted accurately and meaningfully.


3. Some extra complete and “mega” data that I’m interested in:
- [World Happiness Report](https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/world-happiness-report-20152021?select=2021.csv) World Happiness Report from 2015 to 2021, revealing the degree of happiness in different countries/regions with details of GDP, life expectancy, etc.  

- [Wikipedia Movie Plots](https://www.kaggle.com/jrobischon/wikipedia-movie-plots) A dataset containing 34,886 movies on Wikipedia until 2017 with information about release year, director, plot, genre, etc.  

- [Nobel Prize Winners](https://www.kaggle.com/amithasanshuvo/a-visual-history-of-nobel-prize-winners-dataset/code) A dataset available of all Nobel Prize winners from 1901 to 2016 made by the Nobel Foundation, with information about category, motivation, winners’ birth date, etc.  

- [Museum of Modern Art Collection](https://www.kaggle.com/momanyc/museum-collection?select=artworks.csv) A dataset contains 130,262 artworks collections in the Museum of Modern Art, including information about title, artist, date, medium, dimensions, and date acquired by the Museum.
