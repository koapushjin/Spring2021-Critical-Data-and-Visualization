- [Life After Death on Wikipedia](https://pudding.cool/2018/08/wiki-death/)  

This is a data visualization project on how famous people remembered after they die on Wikipedia. Celebrities’ names will commonly be searched more frequently and their Wikipedias will receive a rise in pageview right after they die (though sounds a little bit sad). As the author narratives, this offers us a novel perspective to see those tragic deaths through quantifying the public reactions.

New York Times’ data visualization project on the spread of Covid-19 made last March. New York Times always makes amazing data viz projects and delivers message they’d like to deliver successfully. I reserve my own opinion towards the content and the indications related to Covid-19 facts, yet the visual effects in any sense works very well as a data visualization project.
