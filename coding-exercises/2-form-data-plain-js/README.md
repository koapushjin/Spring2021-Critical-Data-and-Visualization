## Coding Exercise 2 (Form Data, Plain JS)

- A simple [visualization](https://koapush.github.io/cdv-student/coding-exercises/2-form-data-plain-js/) of [survey](https://forms.gle/cp38zxxzJinu7JE66) results for the very first time.
- Inspired by the city heat map.
- Difficulties I met with:
  - Background image: Hard to find a proper image to visualize the bars in an aesthetic way.
  - Gradient color: Suppose to realize the effect of same amount with same color, yet ended up different bars having same color for each side.
- Lessons I learnt:
  - How to collect with Google Form and transform them into JSON format.
  - How to apply gradient color to css styles (seems to be useful in bar chart visualization).
